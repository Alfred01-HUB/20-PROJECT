In this project, I learned how JavaScript event listeners work at a basic level. I started by creating a counter with an initial value of 0. Using JavaScript, I selected the button and the display element by their IDs from the HTML.
I then attached an event listener to the button using the click event. When the button is clicked, a function is triggered. In this case, the function is increment(), which increases the counter value and updates what is displayed on the page.
This helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM: you select an element, listen for a user action, and then run a function that changes something on the page based on that action. It showed me how user interactions can drive behavior in a web application.
