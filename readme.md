In this project, I learned how JavaScript event listeners work by building a counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionality. The counter starts at a default value of 0. Using JavaScript, I selected the buttons and the display element by their IDs from the HTML.
Each button has its own event listener attached to the `click` event. When a button is clicked, a corresponding function runs. The increment function increases the count, the decrement function reduces it, and the reset function returns the value back to zero. After each action, the updated value is reflected immediately on the page.
This project helped me understand how JavaScript connects to the DOM, how multiple event listeners can control different behaviors, and how user interactions directly update the interface in real time.
I got to understand the difference between innerHtml ,textContent, innerText

**Project 3: Mirror Input**

In this project, I learned how the `.value` property works and how it helps retrieve any text entered into an input field. The Mirror Input project focuses on taking the text a user types into an input field and instantly rendering that same text in another element, called the mirror field.

This helped me understand how user input can be captured in real time and displayed dynamically on the page using JavaScript. It also reinforced how input events and DOM manipulation work together to create interactive features.
